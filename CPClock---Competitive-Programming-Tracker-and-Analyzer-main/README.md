# CPClock---Competitive-Programming-Tracker-and-Analyzer
This is a small self project made by me using Next.js, React-bootstrap and some APIs.

•  Built a Next.js 15 web app to track upcoming contests from various Competitive Programming Platforms using contest-hive API  

•  Implemented server-side rendering for improved performance and designed a responsive UI using React Bootstrap 

•  Created a dashboard to show the Codeforces ratings, ranks, and recent contest performance of the user via Codeforces Public API 

•  Integrated Deepseek API to build an AI powered analyzer that reviews solved problems, identifies weak areas and suggests strategies to improve CP skills
